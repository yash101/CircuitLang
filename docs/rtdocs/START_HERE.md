# CircuitLang Runtime Documentation
## Welcome to the CircuitLang Runtime Documentation!

This documentation contains information on how this runtime is built, how it can be improved, and resources/guides on how to use this. As of the first version of this runtime, well, it is the first time I'm writing my own programming language, forget a runtime for a language. It's practically guaranteed to have bugs somewhere or the other. If it doesn't, holy crap!
